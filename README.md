## Installation

```bash
brew tap laggardkernel/tap
brew install laggardkernel/tap/<formula>
# brew tap-pin laggardkernel/tap # deprecated
```

## External Commands

- `brew switch`, the old goodie dropped by brew in 2.6.0
- `brew fix-perm`, fix formula file perms broke by `sudo brew services`
- `brew git-gc`, copied from ymyzk/homebrew-ymyzk, original tap unmaintained
- `brew bat formula`, `bat` path hardcoding removed

## Formulae

Check the `Formula/` folder directly. No longer bother to update introduction here.

## Caveats

- `upx` doesn't build on arm mac, required by Go tools like
  `adguardhome`, `dnslookup`, `filebrowser`, `mosdns`.
